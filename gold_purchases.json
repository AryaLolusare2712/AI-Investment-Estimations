Considering the relatively high market volatility characteristic of this risk level, I advise waiting for a pullback or smaller purchases to take advantage of potential buying opportunities. To mitigate USD-specific risks, I suggest investing 10-20% of the portfolio in physical gold and maintaining a cash reserve equivalent to the percentage allocated to gold.\n\n**Actionable Next Steps:**\n\n1. Monitor gold prices closely for signs of consolidation or a pullback.\n2. Consider buying smaller quantities (e.g., 0.1 oz increments) when a pullback is identified, rather than investing large sums.\n3. Review and adjust the portfolio allocation as needed to maintain a balanced risk profile.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nPlease note that this advice is for informational purposes only and may not be suitable for all investors.
